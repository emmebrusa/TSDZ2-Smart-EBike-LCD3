TSDZ2 Open Source Firmware v20.1C for KT-LCD3 display

Motor changes

 1 - Added field weakening function to increase the motor speed (by mspider65).
 2 - Added other optimizations to motor control, torque sensor and cadence sensor (by mspider65).
 3 - Added startup boost function in POWER assist mode, enable/disable and parameters at display.
 4 - Added HYBRID assist mode, TORQUE + POWER, can be set on the display.
 5 - Added eMTB mode on multiple levels, can be set on the display.
 6 - Improved "Start-up without pedal rotation" function.
 7 - Added a filter to the speed sensor to avoid problems of adjusting the distance from the magnet.
 8 - Added error E08 due to speed sensor failure or missing magnet.
 9 - Added error E03 cadence sensor failure.
10 - Added error E01 overvoltage.
11 - Added error E09 write eeprom problem.
12 - Added "Assist with sensors error" function, to force assistance with sensors problem.
