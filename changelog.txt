TSDZ2 Open Source Firmware v20.1C.4 for KT-LCD3 display

  1 - Improved torque sensor calibration.
  2 - Added adjustment of the adc offset of the pedal torque.
  3 - Added adjustment of the adc range of the pedal torque.
  4 - Added adjustment of the adc angle of the pedal torque.
  5 - Added choice Startup boost mode, at zero cadence or at zero speed.
  6 - Added "Walk Assist" speed settings, one for each level.
  7 - Added "Startup assist", to start from a standstill on difficult climbs.
  8 - Improved progressivity in "Cadence Assist" mode.
  9 - Added choice of soc % calculation mode.
 10 - Added voltage calibration to display.
 11 - Modified standing start, softer.
 12 - Fixed an overflow issue in power assist mode.
 13 - Fix of the calculation of human power.
 14 - Changed "dead time" value to 2.0 us.

TSDZ2 Open Source Firmware v20.1C.3 for KT-LCD3 display

  1 - Updated to v12 version of mspider65 (Hall sensor calibration missing)
  2 - Updated to v13 version of mspider65 (but with 19KHz PWM frequency)
  3 - Improved motor efficiency with high power (by mspider65)
  4 - Improved the problem of delay in restarting with bike in motion (from mspider65 v12)
  5 - Improved standing start response.
  6 - Decreased eMTB torque offset, it was too sensitive at the start.
  7 - Added "Motor deceleration" adjustable 0-100%, (100% = fast stop).
  8 - Speed sensor error threshold time increased (E08).
  9 - Added enable / disable "Field Weakening".


TSDZ2 Open Source Firmware v20.1C for KT-LCD3 display

Motor changes

 1 - Added field weakening function to increase the motor speed (by mspider65).
 2 - Added other optimizations to motor control, torque sensor and cadence sensor (by mspider65).
 3 - Added startup boost function in POWER assist mode, enable/disable and parameters at display.
 4 - Added HYBRID assist mode, TORQUE + POWER, can be set on the display.
 5 - Added eMTB mode on multiple levels, can be set on the display.
 6 - Improved "Start-up without pedal rotation" function.
 7 - Added a filter to the speed sensor to avoid problems of adjusting the distance from the magnet.
 8 - Added error E08 due to speed sensor failure or missing magnet.
 9 - Added error E03 cadence sensor failure.
10 - Added error E01 overvoltage.
11 - Added error E09 write eeprom problem.
12 - Added "Assist with sensors error" function, to force assistance with sensors problem.
